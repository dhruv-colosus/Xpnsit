An expense management system.

Basically we have:

1. A login screen and new user registration area, which is linked to a table having all usernames and passwords taken as input by Python and stored using MySQL (Completed 31/05/19)

2. A framework to add, remove and modify different incomes and expenses of the month, day, week, or whatever time span the user enters for different expense categories

3. Ability to view sum total of all expenses by category and profits and compare them with the last cycle's

4. Plot graphs using matplotlib decribing the relative financial health of the user

5. (Probably not happening that easily) Suggesting the user where to cut his expenditure and give them financial advice (assuming they're financially illiterate)
